    <p>Nature refers to the phenomena of the physical world, including living organisms, geological processes, weather, and the cosmos. It is often associated with the natural environment, 
        which includes wild animals, forests, mountains, rivers, and other elements that have not been significantly 
        altered by human activity. The term "nature" is derived from the Latin word "natura," meaning "birth," and it encompasses everything from smallest microorganisms to vast ecosystems</p>

    <p>Space is often described as the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events occur and have relative position and direction. It is not merely an empty void; rather, 
        it is filled with various forms of matter, energy, and radiation. The majority of space is relatively empty, with only sparse amounts of gas, dust, and cosmic radiation present</p>
